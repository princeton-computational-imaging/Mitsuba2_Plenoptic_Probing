# Mitsuba2 Plenoptic Light-Transport Probing
This repogitory contains the extensions of [Mitsuba2 renderer](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2) for light-transport rendering in consideration of diverse light dimensions: polarization, directions, time, and spectrum. 


## How to use


## About
Our code is based on the original [Mitsuba2 renderer](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2). [Julian Knodt](https://julianknodt.github.io/) mainly developed the extensions and [Seung-Hwan Baek](https://www.shbaek.com/) advised the process.
